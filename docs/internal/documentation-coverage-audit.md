# Documentation Coverage Audit

Generated from the current `packages/*` code, package READMEs, package `docs/` files, and `capell.json` manifests. Treat this as an internal checklist before expanding public docs.

## Scope

- Package directories checked: 42
- Manifest-backed feature packages: 41
- Commands: 38
- Service providers: 58
- Registry/extension registration call sites: 113
- Config keys: 386
- Migrations: 97
- Actions: 330
- Public extension point files: 79

A surface is marked as code-only when its class name, command signature, migration filename, config key, or registry symbol does not appear in the package README or package docs. This is a string check, so review the recommended fixes before creating prose.

`block-library` is the extra package directory without a `capell.json` manifest. It is documented as a `Capell\ContentBlocks\` skeleton rather than listed as an optional installable feature.

## Optional Feature Map

Core documentation should describe these packages as optional unless a host application explicitly installs them.

`capell-app/layout-builder` is not an optional package in this repository anymore. The useful layout builder surface has moved into the admin/frontend core packages, so package docs should refer to "core layout builder APIs" rather than a separate package install.

## Reader Examples To Add Or Keep

Keep these examples near the relevant package docs as they move out of this audit.

### Register a page schema extender

From Campaign Studio's service provider pattern:

```php
use Capell\Admin\Contracts\Extenders\PageSchemaExtender;
use Capell\CampaignStudio\Filament\Extenders\Page\CampaignPageSchemaExtender;

$this->app->singleton(CampaignPageSchemaExtender::class);
$this->app->tag(CampaignPageSchemaExtender::class, PageSchemaExtender::TAG);
```

### Register package settings

From Newsletter's settings registration pattern:

```php
use Capell\Core\Support\Settings\SettingsSchemaRegistry;
use Capell\Newsletter\Settings\NewsletterSettings;

$registry = resolve(SettingsSchemaRegistry::class);
$registry->registerSettingsClass('newsletter', NewsletterSettings::class);
```

### Register package migrations

From packages using Spatie package tools:

```php
$package
    ->name('capell-campaign-studio')
    ->hasConfigFile('capell-campaign-studio')
    ->hasMigrations([
        '2026_05_10_190843_01_create_campaign_groups_table',
        '2026_05_10_190843_03_create_campaign_landing_pages_table',
    ]);
```

### Clear cached URLs for a model

From HTML Cache's action API:

```php
use Capell\HtmlCache\Actions\ClearCachedUrlsForModelAction;

$clearedUrlCount = ClearCachedUrlsForModelAction::run($model, refresh: true);
```

### Add a frontend render hook

From Search's header hook pattern:

```php
use Capell\Frontend\Enums\RenderHookLocation;
use Capell\Frontend\Support\Render\RenderHookRegistry;

$registry->register(
    RenderHookLocation::HeaderAfter,
    static fn (): string => view('capell-search::components.form')->render(),
);
```

### Declare package manifest metadata

Use `capell.json` to keep package availability explicit:

```json
{
    "name": "capell-app/hero",
    "slug": "hero",
    "kind": "package",
    "surfaces": ["frontend", "console"],
    "commands": {
        "setup": "capell:hero-setup"
    }
}
```

## Package-Specific Follow-Up

Use this list before expanding more prose. It keeps the next docs pass focused on surfaces developers actually touch.
