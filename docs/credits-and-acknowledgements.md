# Theme Agency Credits And Acknowledgements

Theme Agency is part of the Capell package set. This page names the main frameworks, packages, authors, and services this package leans on, with a short note about what they make possible here. It is intentionally shorter than the repository-wide credits page and closer to the package itself.

Package role: Expressive agency renderer for Capell theme system

## Shared Foundations

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com), created by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell), gives this package routing, service providers, Eloquent, validation, queues, events, auth, caching, and the normal Laravel testing surface.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Packagist](https://packagist.org), and [GitHub](https://github.com) make the package install, split, and release workflow possible. Composer and Packagist deserve a special nod because Capell packages live and update through Composer metadata.
- [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/blade) keeps package views close to Laravel, easy to override, and friendly to theme packages.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), by [Tailwind Labs](https://tailwindcss.com), gives package themes and frontend views a shared styling language.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev), by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) and the Vite team, keeps package asset builds fast and predictable.
- [Pest](https://pestphp.com), [Orchestra Testbench](https://packages.tools/testbench), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint), and [Rector](https://getrector.com) keep this package easier to test, review, and update when bugs are fixed.

## Capell Packages Used Here

- [Capell Core](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Theme Agency builds on.
- [Foundation Theme](../../foundation-theme/README.md) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Theme Agency builds on.
- [Foundation Theme](../../foundation-theme/README.md) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Theme Agency builds on.

## What We Especially Appreciate

Theme Agency is useful as an expressive renderer that still obeys theme runtime contracts. Visual fixes can land in the theme without changing the shared theme runtime.

## Keeping This Page Current

When Theme Agency adds a new framework, service, or third-party package that becomes part of the user-facing workflow, update this page and the package README together. Credits should explain the practical help we get from a dependency, not just list a package name.
