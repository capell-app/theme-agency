Status: **Available, no schema impact** · Kind: **theme** · Tier: **premium** · Bundle: **theme-studio** · Contexts: **frontend** · Product group: **Capell Theme Studio**

## What This Plugin Adds

Theme Agency registers an expressive agency renderer for Capell Theme Studio.

- Agency theme service provider.
- Theme renderer/views for agency-style Theme Studio output.
- Dependency on Default Theme and Theme Studio Core.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Adds a renderer package that plugs into Theme Studio Core rather than changing Capell core rendering contracts.

**For teams:** Provides an agency-focused visual option for sites managed through Theme Studio.

## Screens And Workflow

Screenshots are generated from [docs/screenshots.json](docs/screenshots.json) during package deployment.

- Theme Studio preset selection showing Agency.
- Frontend page rendered with Agency theme.
- Theme preview URL output.

## Technical Shape

- AgencyThemeServiceProvider registers the renderer.
- Requires capell-app/default-theme and capell-app/theme-studio-core.
- No migrations, config, routes, resources, or models are present.

## Data Model

- This package does not own data.
- It reads Theme Studio runtime data and core page content through Theme Studio Core.

## Install Impact

- Adds an Agency renderer to Theme Studio.
- No database changes.
- No admin navigation by itself.
- No public routes by itself.

## Common Pitfalls

- Install Theme Studio Core before using this renderer.
- Verify frontend assets from Default Theme are available.

## Quick Start

1. Install the package with `composer require capell-app/theme-agency`.
2. Register the package provider through Composer discovery and clear cached config if the host app uses config caching.
3. Open the new admin surface or integration point and verify the result.
