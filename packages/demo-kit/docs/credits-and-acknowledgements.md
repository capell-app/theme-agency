# Demo Kit Credits And Acknowledgements

Demo Kit is part of the Capell package set. This page names the main frameworks, packages, authors, and services this package leans on, with a short note about what they make possible here. It is intentionally shorter than the repository-wide credits page and closer to the package itself.

Package role: Demo content and media kit for Capell

## Shared Foundations

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com), created by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell), gives this package routing, service providers, Eloquent, validation, queues, events, auth, caching, and the normal Laravel testing surface.
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) and the [Filament project](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) give this package admin resources, pages, widgets, forms, tables, actions, and panel integration.
- [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/blade) keeps package views close to Laravel, easy to override, and friendly to theme packages.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), by [Tailwind Labs](https://tailwindcss.com), gives package themes and frontend views a shared styling language.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev), by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) and the Vite team, keeps package asset builds fast and predictable.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Packagist](https://packagist.org), and [GitHub](https://github.com) make the package install, split, and release workflow possible. Composer and Packagist deserve a special nod because Capell packages live and update through Composer metadata.
- [Pest](https://pestphp.com), [Orchestra Testbench](https://packages.tools/testbench), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint), and [Rector](https://getrector.com) keep this package easier to test, review, and update when bugs are fixed.

## Capell Packages Used Here

- [Capell Admin](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Demo Kit builds on.
- [Capell Core](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Demo Kit builds on.
- [Capell Frontend](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Demo Kit builds on.

## What We Especially Appreciate

Demo Kit is useful because empty installs are hard to judge. Demo content, media, and seedable examples make package bugs easier to reproduce and the product easier to understand.

## Keeping This Page Current

When Demo Kit adds a new framework, service, or third-party package that becomes part of the user-facing workflow, update this page and the package README together. Credits should explain the practical help we get from a dependency, not just list a package name.
