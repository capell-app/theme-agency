# Demo Kit

Demo content and media kit for Capell.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/demo-kit`
- Namespace: `Capell\DemoKit\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin, console
- Service providers: `packages/demo-kit/src/Providers/DemoKitServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`, `capell-app/frontend`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Creates repeatable demo content and media so package demos, sales reviews, screenshots, and QA runs start from known data.
- Helps owners and stakeholders see a realistic Capell site without hand-building fixture pages every time.
- Keeps demo creation in package Actions and setup flows so production content boundaries stay separate from presentation examples.

## Best Used With

- [Foundation Theme](../foundation-theme/README.md)
- [Layout Builder](../layout-builder/README.md)
- [Content Sections](../content-sections/README.md)

## What It Adds

Generated demo content and media kit for Capell.

- Randomised example site content and media for local Capell demos.
- Demo content provider for admin and frontend package setup.
- Demo assets that help validate a package install quickly.
- A package-owned doctor command for validating generated demo installs.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Keeps Demo Kit package responsibilities isolated behind providers, actions, data objects, and package-owned resources where the package needs them.

**For teams:** Makes the Capell Foundation capability easier to explain, install, and verify during package selection.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

**Capell packages used here**

- [Capell Admin](https://github.com/capell-app/admin)
- [Capell Core](https://github.com/capell-app/core)
- [Capell Frontend](https://github.com/capell-app/frontend)

**Open-source packages used here**

- No extra third-party Composer package beyond the Capell package stack is required here.

## Admin Surface

- Pages: `DemoKitPage`.

## Commands

- `capell:admin-demo {--user=} {--languages=} {--url=} {--sites=} {--site-count=} {--page-count=} {--seed=}` (packages/demo-kit/src/Console/Commands/AdminDemoCommand.php)
- `capell:demo {--user} {--languages=} {--packages} {--sites=} {--url} {--force}` (packages/demo-kit/src/Console/Commands/DemoCommand.php)
- `capell:demo-kit-full-demo {--url=} {--user=} {--languages=} {--sites=} {--site-count=} {--page-count=} {--seed=} {--force}` (packages/demo-kit/src/Console/Commands/FullDemoCommand.php)
- `capell:demo-kit-kitchen-sink` installs the `kitchen-sink-demo` CMS authoring/reference fixture. It is for block, asset, accessibility, and rendered HTML inspection, not as a production landing page template.
- The Kitchen Sink page intentionally server-renders only the structured-text reference block up front. The remaining reference block families are seeded as Layout Builder `lazy_fragment` instances with `visible` loading so local Lighthouse runs measure the page against a smaller initial HTML payload.
- `capell:demo-kit-doctor {--json}` validates the package-owned demo health checks.

## Demo Generation

Demo Kit keeps publishable config focused on scale and archive safety. The actual demo content pools live in code so the package can generate varied demos without forcing a huge static page tree into application config.

Useful options:

- `--site-count=5` creates a random set of site names from the package pool.
- `--page-count=30` creates that many generated pages per site.
- `--languages=all`, `--languages=en,fr`, or `--languages=random:3` controls the language pool.
- `--seed=1234` makes the generated plan repeatable for screenshots, tests, and bug reports.

Omit `--seed` for a fresh random demo on each run.

## Kitchen Sink Lighthouse Notes

The Kitchen Sink fixture expects the serving layer to provide text compression for realistic Lighthouse scoring. Local Docker/web-server or production proxies should enable gzip or Brotli for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before comparing scores against the `kitchen-sink-demo` baseline.

## Content Rendering Boundary

Demo Kit must keep saved CMS content portable. `DemoCreator` should only persist minimal editable copy in content fields: simple paragraphs, headings, lists, links, and light emphasis are fine. Do not store designed HTML, utility classes, component classes, layout wrappers, tables, cards, pricing grids, hero sections, or other presentation structures in page or block translations.

When demo content needs a designed public surface, create or reuse a Capell Layout Builder block and render it from package Blade under `packages/demo-kit/resources/views`. The seeded database record should point at that block or view through Capell metadata, while the Blade view owns the markup and classes.

Current examples:

- `demo-page-content` renders designed demo pages through `capell-demo-kit::components.block.demo-page-content`.
- Homepage demo sections render through `capell-demo-kit::components.block.homepage-section`.

## Data And Persistence

- Config: `packages/demo-kit/config/capell-demo-kit.php`.
- Content pools: `packages/demo-kit/src/Support/DemoContentPool.php`.
- Generated plan: `packages/demo-kit/src/Actions/BuildDemoGenerationPlanAction.php`.
- Designed public markup: `packages/demo-kit/resources/views/components/block`.

## Extension Points

- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/demo-kit` in the host Capell application.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Docs

- [docs index](docs/README.md)
- [overview.md](docs/overview.md)
- [credits-and-acknowledgements.md](docs/credits-and-acknowledgements.md)

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/demo-kit/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
