# Diagnostics Credits And Acknowledgements

Diagnostics is part of the Capell package set. This page names the main frameworks, packages, authors, and services this package leans on, with a short note about what they make possible here. It is intentionally shorter than the repository-wide credits page and closer to the package itself.

Package role: Developer and operational diagnostics for Capell CMS.

## Shared Foundations

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com), created by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell), gives this package routing, service providers, Eloquent, validation, queues, events, auth, caching, and the normal Laravel testing surface.
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) and the [Filament project](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) give this package admin resources, pages, widgets, forms, tables, actions, and panel integration.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Packagist](https://packagist.org), and [GitHub](https://github.com) make the package install, split, and release workflow possible. Composer and Packagist deserve a special nod because Capell packages live and update through Composer metadata.
- [Pest](https://pestphp.com), [Orchestra Testbench](https://packages.tools/testbench), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint), and [Rector](https://getrector.com) keep this package easier to test, review, and update when bugs are fixed.

## Capell Packages Used Here

- [Capell Admin](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Diagnostics builds on.
- [Capell Core](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Diagnostics builds on.

## Open-source Packages And Authors

- [Filament Jobs Monitor](https://github.com/ultraviolettes/filament-jobs-monitor), published on Packagist as [`croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor`](https://packagist.org/packages/croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor), provides the Laravel queue-event telemetry behind Diagnostics Queue Operations. Capell deliberately treats this package as the upstream monitor and wraps it instead of forking it.
- [Laravel Actions](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions), by Loris Leiva, keeps package behaviour in small action classes instead of burying it in pages, commands, or controllers.
- [Spatie Laravel Data](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-data), by Ruben Van Assche and Spatie, keeps request state, settings, and package results typed at the boundaries.

## What We Especially Appreciate

Diagnostics pays off when something is already broken. It gathers package, cache, queue, migration, and permission state into one admin surface so bug reports can start from evidence.

The Queue Operations page is a good example of that boundary: [`croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor`](https://github.com/ultraviolettes/filament-jobs-monitor) captures queue monitor history, while Capell Diagnostics adds Capell queue discovery, guarded install defaults, typed Actions, safer retry/delete controls, and product-specific screenshots.

## Keeping This Page Current

When Diagnostics adds a new framework, service, or third-party package that becomes part of the user-facing workflow, update this page and the package README together. Credits should explain the practical help we get from a dependency, not just list a package name.
