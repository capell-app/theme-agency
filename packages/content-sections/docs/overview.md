# Content Sections Overview

Content Sections adds reusable page sections that can be edited in the Capell admin and rendered through package-owned Blade components on the public frontend.

Use it when a site needs shared heroes, FAQs, pricing blocks, statistics, testimonials, timelines, tables, teams, logos, and similar structured page sections without storing presentation markup in page content fields.

## Hard Dependencies

- `capell-app/admin`
- `capell-app/content-blocks`
- `capell-app/core`
- `capell-app/frontend`
- `capell-app/layout-builder`

## What It Adds

- `SectionResource` in the admin content navigation under Pages.
- Create, edit, and list pages for reusable section records.
- A section assets relation manager for records with attached assets.
- Section blueprint/configurator support for common marketing and editorial blocks.
- Frontend Blade components for rendered section blocks.
- Livewire helpers used by admin asset and block selection workflows.

## Admin Surfaces

| Surface                        | Purpose                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SectionResource` index        | Browse and filter reusable sections.                                                |
| `CreateSection`                | Create a section from a registered blueprint.                                       |
| `EditSection`                  | Edit section details, translations, related content, settings, actions, and assets. |
| `SectionAssetsRelationManager` | Manage assets attached to a section.                                                |
| `SectionAlertsWidget`          | Shows section-level warnings when editing records.                                  |
| `ModalTableSelect`             | Admin selection modal used when linking section content.                            |

## Editor Workflow

The default `content_first` mode groups editable content by layout placement so editors can update titles, copy, logos, and assigned records without opening the full canvas.

Use `layout_first` when the editor needs placement and structure control. Breakpoint controls let editors inspect desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts; breakpoint-specific container spans fall back to the base span when no override exists.

Undo and redo apply to unsaved changes in the current editing session. Saving establishes the new baseline and clears the undo history.

Layout areas let themes expose places outside the main page body. For example, a theme can register a `header` area so editors can place normal Content Sections elements in site chrome without a separate header-content model.

## Frontend Surfaces

Content Sections renders through package Blade views under `resources/views/components/section`.

The package-owned public block views include:

- accordion
- call to action
- comparison
- content
- counter
- divider
- FAQ
- features
- hero
- logos
- pricing
- simple list
- stats
- table
- tabs
- team
- testimonial
- timeline

Public views should receive hydrated render data from Capell payload builders and components. They should not query the database or expose admin/editor state.

## Screenshot Coverage

The screenshot contract is stored in [screenshots.json](screenshots.json). The first isolated audit pass found these surfaces that need final capture in an installed demo app:

- admin section index;
- create section form;
- edit section form with warnings and asset relation manager;
- modal section/block selector;
- a frontend page rendering each registered section block family.

## Install And Verify

Install in a Capell app with only the hard dependencies listed above:

```bash
composer require capell-app/content-sections
```

Then run the package tests from this repository:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/content-sections/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Known Audit Notes

Content Sections has both admin and frontend surfaces. Final visual screenshots should be captured from a seeded app that includes `layout-builder` and `content-blocks`, because those are hard dependencies for editing and rendering section blocks.
