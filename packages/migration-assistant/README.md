# Migration Assistant

Migration Assistant export, import, and rollback report workflows for Capell.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/migration-assistant`
- Namespace: `Capell\MigrationAssistant\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin, queue, database
- Service providers: `packages/migration-assistant/src/Providers/MigrationAssistantServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`
- Third-party dependencies: `lorisleiva/laravel-actions`, `spatie/laravel-package-tools`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Provides import workflows, source readers, mapping, preview, validation, execution state, and rollback reports for content moves.
- Helps owners de-risk migrations by showing what will change before import and what changed afterwards.
- Gives developers extension points for sources, targets, relations, row contributors, collision detection, and rollback behavior.

## Best Used With

- [WordPress Importer](../wordpress-importer/README.md)
- [Media Library](../media-library/README.md)
- [Diagnostics](../diagnostics/README.md)

## What It Adds

- Migration Assistant export, import, and rollback report workflows for Capell.
- Admin resources: `ImportSessionResource`.
- Recovery Center page import workflow: upload, review, resolve relations, validate, queue execution, and inspect rollback evidence.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Separates migration work into services, actions, DTOs, jobs, events, source readers, target registries, and resolver contracts so package and flat-file data can be moved with explicit ownership rules.

**For teams:** Supports controlled migration workflows where content, media, relationships, source files, and rollback evidence can be reviewed before and after import.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

**Capell packages used here**

- [Capell Admin](https://github.com/capell-app/admin)
- [Capell Core](https://github.com/capell-app/core)

**Open-source packages used here**

- [Laravel Actions](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions) - single-purpose action classes that keep package workflows out of controllers and Filament resources.
- [Spatie Laravel Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools) - Laravel package bootstrapping for config, migrations, commands, translations, and service provider setup.

## Screens And Workflow

Screenshots are generated from [docs/screenshots.json](docs/screenshots.json) during package deployment.

- Import session index or host admin surface.
- Page import upload and validation workflow.
- Import validation summary.
- Relation resolution review.
- Rollback report view.
- Package export intent screen.

## Technical Shape

- `MigrationAssistantServiceProvider` registers the package.
- Config file: migration-assistant.php.
- Migrations create import_rollback_reports and import_sessions, including generic import target columns.
- Jobs execute import plans.
- Events report import completed or failed.
- Services cover package reading, writing, CSV/XML reading, mapping, validation, relation resolution, media ingest, preview, and rollback reporting.
- WordPress WXR support is intentionally provided by the separate `capell-app/wordpress-importer` package, which registers a source reader with Migration Assistant.

## Admin Surface

- Resources: `ImportSessionResource`.
- Pages: `ImportPagesPage`, `ListImportSessions`, `ViewImportSession`. `ImportSitesPage` remains a hidden placeholder until the site-import wizard ships.

## Runtime Surface

- Jobs: `ExecuteImportPlanJob`.
- Commands: `migration-assistant:export`, `migration-assistant:import`, `migration-assistant:status`, `migration-assistant:rollback-report`, `migration-assistant:rollback-execute`.

## Data And Persistence

- import_rollback_reports stores the import session, created model ids, source filename/checksum, summary counts, executing user/time, and manual rollback instructions.
- import_sessions stores import kind, generic target type/id, status, manifest, decisions, validation state, and result summary.
- Retention and deletion rules should be verified against the host application policy.

- Models: `ImportRollbackReport`, `ImportSession`.
- Migrations: `2026_05_10_190859_01_create_import_sessions_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190859_02_create_import_rollback_reports_table.php`, `2026_06_04_000001_rename_import_rollback_reports_table.php`.
- Config: `packages/migration-assistant/config/migration-assistant.php`.
- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.

## Extension Points

- Contracts: `ImportSessionSubNavigationExtender`, `ImportSourceReader`, `MigrationAssistantContextResolver`, `MigrationAssistantRowContributor`, `PageCollisionDetector`, `PageImportTargetResolver`.
- Events: `ImportCompleted`, `ImportFailed`.
- Listeners: `SendImportSessionNotifications`.
- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install Impact

- Adds import_rollback_reports and import_sessions tables.
- Adds migration-assistant queue configuration.
- Uses disk and path config for imports, exports, and working files.
- May require queue workers for long-running imports.
- No public routes are registered by this package.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/migration-assistant` in the host Capell application.
- Run migrations through the host application package install flow.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Admin And Access

- Import session access is guarded by `ImportSessionPolicy`.
- Policy support: OwnershipMap (packages/migration-assistant/src/Policy/OwnershipMap.php)

## Common Pitfalls

- Configure MIGRATOR_QUEUE and MIGRATOR_DISK before large imports.
- Check upload and package size limits before importing client archives.
- Run queue workers before testing async import jobs.
- Review relation resolution before applying imported data.
- Use `migration-assistant:export --page={id} --json` or `migration-assistant:export --site={id} --json` for scripted package creation.
- Use `migration-assistant:import {archive} --json` to create and validate an import session; add `--execute` to queue it or `--sync` for controlled one-off execution.
- Use `migration-assistant:status --json`, `migration-assistant:rollback-report {session} --json`, and `migration-assistant:rollback-execute {session} --dry-run --json` for headless CI or migration audit checks.

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/migration-assistant/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
- Use backed enums for persisted values and enum labels for Filament options.
