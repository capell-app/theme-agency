# Form Builder

FormBuilder adds form definitions, encrypted submissions, frontend Livewire rendering, conditional logic, multi-step forms, calculations, file upload rules, spam scoring, payment fields, and submission workflows to Capell.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/form-builder`
- Namespace: `Capell\FormBuilder\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin resource, frontend Livewire, database
- Service providers: `packages/form-builder/src/Providers/FormBuilderServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`, `capell-app/frontend`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Lets editors build and publish forms while the package owns encrypted submissions, validation, notifications, and status handling.
- Helps owners collect leads, enquiries, and operational requests without custom Livewire work for every form.
- Gives developers a predictable form/submission model that can connect to Public Actions, Email Studio, and campaign workflows.

## Best Used With

- [Public Actions](../public-actions/README.md)
- [Email Studio](../email-studio/README.md)
- [Campaign Studio](../campaign-studio/README.md)

## What It Adds

FormBuilder adds form definitions, encrypted submissions, frontend Livewire rendering, conditional logic, multi-step forms, calculations, file upload rules, spam scoring, payment fields, and submission workflows to Capell.

- Form and submission models.
- Admin submissions resource under the reports navigation group.
- Frontend Livewire form component.
- Actions for validation, conditional visibility, multi-step grouping, calculations, spam scoring, submission creation, archiving, read state, and spam marking.
- FormSubmitted event.
- Configurable submission storage, request metadata collection, file upload rules, payment field metadata, notifications, and replies.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Keeps form schema, settings, submission payload, and metadata in data objects and casts so form handling remains typed across layers.

**For teams:** Lets editors collect responses from structured websites while keeping submission review inside the Capell admin workflow.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

**Capell packages used here**

- [Capell Admin](https://github.com/capell-app/admin)
- [Capell Core](https://github.com/capell-app/core)
- [Capell Frontend](https://github.com/capell-app/frontend)

**Open-source packages used here**

- No extra third-party Composer package beyond the Capell package stack is required here.

## Screens And Workflow

Screenshots are generated from [docs/screenshots.json](docs/screenshots.json) during package deployment.

- FormBuilder admin index.
- Create/edit form schema screen.
- Submissions index.
- Frontend form output.
- Submission detail view.

## Technical Shape

- FormBuilderServiceProvider registers the package.
- Config file: capell-form-builder.php.
- Migrations create form-builder and submissions.
- Models: Form and Submission.
- Livewire component: FormComponent.
- EncryptedDataCast protects stored submission data.

## Runtime Surface

- Livewire: `FormComponent`.

## Data And Persistence

- form-builder belongs to sites and stores handle, schema, settings, and active state.
- submissions belongs to form-builder and sites and stores payload, meta, status, and submitted_at.
- Submission payload and metadata are represented by data objects.
- Deletion and retention rules should be verified against the host application policy.

- Models: `Form`, `Submission`.
- Migrations: `2026_05_10_190849_01_create_form-builder_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190849_02_create_submissions_table.php`.
- Config: `packages/form-builder/config/capell-form-builder.php`.
- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.

## Extension Points

- Events: `FormSubmitted`.
- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install Impact

- Adds form-builder and submissions tables.
- Adds frontend Livewire form component.
- Adds config keys for storing submissions, IP address collection, user agent collection, throttling, and spam scoring.
- No routes are visible in this package.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/form-builder` in the host Capell application.
- Run migrations through the host application package install flow.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Admin And Access

- Admin resource: `SubmissionResource`.
- Navigation: Form submissions under the reports group.
- Access is governed by `SubmissionPolicy` and site-scoped submission queries.

## Common Pitfalls

- Disable IP/user agent collection where privacy policy requires it.
- Run migrations before rendering form components.
- Validate field schema before accepting public submissions.
- Tune spam scoring thresholds and blocked keywords for the site’s risk profile before using automatic spam triage in production.

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/form-builder/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Treat public routes as untrusted input and keep validation, permission checks, and side effects inside actions or dedicated services.
- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
- Use backed enums for persisted values and enum labels for Filament options.
