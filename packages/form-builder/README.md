# Form Builder

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

## What This Plugin Adds

Form Builder is an **Available**, **Schema-owning** Capell package in the **Capell FormBuilder** product group. It ships as `capell-app/form-builder` and extends these surfaces: admin, frontend.

Build site-scoped forms in Capell and capture spam-filtered, encrypted submissions into a per-site triage inbox with one-click email replies.

After install, admins get package-owned management surfaces and public users may see package-owned frontend output or routes.

Status details:

- Status: Available
- Tier: premium
- Bundle: form-builder
- Composer package: `capell-app/form-builder`
- Namespace: `Capell\FormBuilder`
- Theme key: not applicable

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** The package gives developers package-owned service providers, Actions, Data objects, models, Filament classes, and Blade views instead of pushing this behaviour into core or application code.

**For teams:** Build site-scoped forms in Capell and capture spam-filtered, encrypted submissions into a per-site triage inbox with one-click email replies.

- Cache tags: `form-builder`.

## Data Model

- Required tables: `forms`, `submissions`.
- Models: `Form`, `Submission`.
- Migration files: `2026_05_10_190849_01_create_form-builder_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190849_02_create_submissions_table.php`.
- Migration impact: run host migrations through the package install flow before opening package surfaces.
- Deletion/retention behaviour: Docs gap unless the package has an explicit pruning command, retention setting, or tested cascade path.

## Install Impact

- Admin navigation: adds package-owned Filament classes when registered.
- Permissions: none declared in `capell.json`.
- Public routes: none detected in package route files.
- Database changes: package migrations are declared.
- Settings: no package settings declared.
- Queues or schedules: none detected in standard package paths.
- Cache tags: `form-builder`.
- Commands: console command classes detected: `ExportSubmissionsCommand`.

## Common Pitfalls

- Run migrations before opening package resources or public routes.
- Keep public Blade and cached HTML free of authoring markers, model IDs, permissions, signed editor URLs, and lazy database queries.
- Keep `composer.json`, `composer.local.json`, `capell.json`, docs, screenshots, and tests aligned when the package surface changes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Package surface is missing after install | Provider or manifest is not loaded | Confirm `capell.json`, package `composer.json`, and provider registration | Reinstall the package, refresh Composer autoload, and clear host caches |
| Admin screen or command fails on missing table | Package migrations have not run | Check the tables listed in `Data Model` | Run host migrations and rerun the focused package test |
| Public output leaks unexpected state | Render data, cache variation, or authoring boundary has regressed | Check public Blade, cache tags, and public-output safety tests | Move data loading out of Blade and rerun the package public-output tests |

## Quick Start

1. Install the package: `composer require capell-app/form-builder`.
2. Run the required setup: `php artisan migrate`.
3. Open the related Capell admin surface and verify Form Builder appears.
