# Dashboard Reports

At-a-glance content-health and publishing-activity widgets for Capell admin dashboards.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/dashboard-reports`
- Namespace: `Capell\DashboardReports\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin
- Service providers: `packages/dashboard-reports/src/Providers/AdminServiceProvider.php`, `packages/dashboard-reports/src/Providers/DashboardReportsServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`
- Third-party dependencies: `lorisleiva/laravel-actions`, `spatie/laravel-data`, `spatie/laravel-package-tools`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Turns common CMS health and content signals into dashboard widgets that operators can scan quickly.
- Helps owners understand content health and publishing trends without opening several admin resources.
- Gives developers small reporting Actions that can be tested independently from Filament widget rendering.

## Best Used With

- [Diagnostics](../diagnostics/README.md)
- [Publishing Studio](../publishing-studio/README.md)
- [Login Audit](../login-audit/README.md)

## What It Adds

- Content Health and Publishing Trend widgets for Capell admin screens.
- Filtered Content Health drill-downs into the Page resource for scheduled, expired, URL-less, and stale pages.
- CSV exports for both dashboard widgets through `capell:dashboard-reports:export`.
- Diagnostics checks for install state, dashboard widgets, settings contribution, provider binding, and page-list filters.
- Service providers for package and admin registration.
- Typed reporting Actions that other operations packages can build on.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Keeps Dashboard Reports package responsibilities isolated behind providers, actions, data objects, and package-owned resources where the package needs them.

**For teams:** Makes the Capell Operations capability easier to explain, install, and verify during package selection.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

| Area      | Path                                       | Purpose                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actions   | `packages/dashboard-reports/src/Actions`   | Domain operations. Test these directly where possible.              |
| Data      | `packages/dashboard-reports/src/Data`      | Structured payloads, form state, view models, and integration data. |
| Filament  | `packages/dashboard-reports/src/Filament`  | Admin resources, pages, widgets, and settings UI.                   |
| Providers | `packages/dashboard-reports/src/Providers` | Registration, extension hooks, routes, migrations, and resources.   |
| Resources | `packages/dashboard-reports/resources`     | Views, translations, assets, and package resources.                 |
| Tests     | `packages/dashboard-reports/tests`         | Package-level Pest coverage.                                        |

## Admin Surface

- Widgets: `ContentHealthWidget`, `PublishingTrendChartWidget`.
- Page table extender: `DashboardReportsPageTableExtender` adds a hidden-by-default Content Health filter target for widget deep links.
- Command: `capell:dashboard-reports:export content-health|publishing-trend --path=storage/app/report.csv`.

## Data And Persistence

- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.
- The package does not create reporting tables. It reads Capell page state through site-scoped queries.

## Extension Points

- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/dashboard-reports` in the host Capell application.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Docs

- [docs index](docs/README.md)
- [overview.md](docs/overview.md)
- [credits-and-acknowledgements.md](docs/credits-and-acknowledgements.md)

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/dashboard-reports/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
