# Campaign Studio

Campaign Studio adds campaign groups, landing-page variants, audience targeting, experiments, CTA widgets, conversion goals, UTM attribution, funnel reporting, and conversion reporting to Capell.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/campaign-studio`
- Namespace: `Capell\CampaignStudio\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin, console, database
- Service providers: `packages/campaign-studio/src/Providers/AdminServiceProvider.php`, `packages/campaign-studio/src/Providers/CampaignStudioServiceProvider.php`, `packages/campaign-studio/src/Providers/FrontendServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`, `capell-app/form-builder`, `capell-app/frontend`, `capell-app/insights`
- Third-party dependencies: `lorisleiva/laravel-actions`, `spatie/laravel-data`, `spatie/laravel-package-tools`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Connects campaign landing pages, landing-page variants, audience targeting, experiments, CTA widgets, UTM attribution, conversion goals, funnel reporting, and reporting into one growth workflow.
- Helps owners see which campaigns and pages are producing conversions without stitching together custom admin widgets.
- Gives developers package-owned Actions and models for attribution, funnels, overview stats, and campaign URLs.

## Best Used With

- [Insights](../insights/README.md)
- [GA4 Reports](../ga4-reports/README.md)
- [Form Builder](../form-builder/README.md)

## What It Adds

Campaign Studio adds campaign groups, landing-page variants, audience targeting, experiments, CTA widgets, conversion goals, UTM attribution, funnel reporting, and conversion reporting to Capell.

- Campaign Filament resources for groups, landing pages, goals, and CTA widgets.
- Campaign dashboard widgets.
- Page schema extender for campaign fields.
- core layout builder widget configurators for campaign hero, CTA, and lead form widgets.
- Landing-page variant selection from UTM audience data, with optional experiment sync when Experiments is installed.
- Campaign hero widget CTAs can append configured UTM metadata through the shared campaign URL builder.
- Campaign conversion funnel reporting from conversion goals and recorded conversions.
- Conversion recording actions for page views, CTA clicks, and form submissions.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Connects Capell pages, FormBuilder, Insights, and core layout builder APIs through explicit actions and listener classes instead of inline resource logic.

**For teams:** Lets marketing and editorial teams connect landing pages to goals and see which campaign-studio convert.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

## Install And Setup

## Common Pitfalls

- Install dependent packages before expecting attribution from form-builder or insights.
- Check UTM keys before launch.
- Configure campaign hero UTM fields when hero CTAs should carry campaign attribution.
- Create conversion goals before reporting on landing page success.

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/campaign-studio/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
- Use backed enums for persisted values and enum labels for Filament options.
