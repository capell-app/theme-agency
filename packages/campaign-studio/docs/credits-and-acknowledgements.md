# Campaign Studio Credits And Acknowledgements

Campaign Studio is part of the Capell package set. This page names the main frameworks, packages, authors, and services this package leans on, with a short note about what they make possible here. It is intentionally shorter than the repository-wide credits page and closer to the package itself.

Package role: Campaign landing pages, CTA widgets, UTM attribution, conversion goals, and campaign insights.

## Shared Foundations

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com), created by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell), gives this package routing, service providers, Eloquent, validation, queues, events, auth, caching, and the normal Laravel testing surface.
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) and the [Filament project](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) give this package admin resources, pages, widgets, forms, tables, actions, and panel integration.
- [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/blade) keeps package views close to Laravel, easy to override, and friendly to theme packages.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), by [Tailwind Labs](https://tailwindcss.com), gives package themes and frontend views a shared styling language.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev), by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) and the Vite team, keeps package asset builds fast and predictable.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Packagist](https://packagist.org), and [GitHub](https://github.com) make the package install, split, and release workflow possible. Composer and Packagist deserve a special nod because Capell packages live and update through Composer metadata.
- [Pest](https://pestphp.com), [Orchestra Testbench](https://packages.tools/testbench), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint), and [Rector](https://getrector.com) keep this package easier to test, review, and update when bugs are fixed.

## Capell Packages Used Here

- [Capell Admin](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Campaign Studio builds on.
- [Insights](../../insights/README.md) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Campaign Studio builds on.
- [Capell Core](https://docs.capell.app) supplies the Capell-side contracts, surfaces, or runtime that Campaign Studio builds on.

## Open-source Packages And Authors

- [Laravel Actions](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions), by Loris Leiva, keeps package behaviour in small action classes instead of burying it in pages, commands, or controllers.
- [Spatie Laravel Data](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-data), by Ruben Van Assche and Spatie, keeps request state, settings, and package results typed at the boundaries.
- [Spatie Laravel Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools), by Freek Van der Herten and Spatie, keeps service provider setup, config publishing, migrations, and command registration predictable.

## What We Especially Appreciate

The useful feature is attribution staying close to the landing page. UTM data, CTA widgets, conversion goals, and insights can be fixed or extended together without turning every marketing page into custom code.

## Keeping This Page Current

When Campaign Studio adds a new framework, service, or third-party package that becomes part of the user-facing workflow, update this page and the package README together. Credits should explain the practical help we get from a dependency, not just list a package name.
