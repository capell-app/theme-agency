# Capell Inertia React Adapter — Improvement & Growth Plan

> Package: capell-app/inertia-react-adapter · Kind: plugin · Tier: core · Product group: Capell Frontend · Bundle: frontend · Status: Active

## 1. Snapshot

## Completed Improvement Slices

- **2026-06-14:** Routed the vendor asset condition through the shared `ResolveInertiaAdapterKeyAction`, so trimmed adapter config and invalid config behave consistently across public props and asset registration. Tightened health checks to verify the registered adapter belongs to this package and points at the expected build entrypoint. Added this package-local plan and refreshed generated docs placeholders.

## 2. Improvements

1. **Shipped 2026-06-14: align asset condition with sanitized adapter config.** The build condition now uses the bridge resolver instead of raw config, so `CAPELL_INERTIA_ADAPTER=" react "` enables the React build and invalid config falls back away from it. — `src/Providers/InertiaReactAdapterServiceProvider.php`, `tests/Feature/InertiaReactAdapterServiceProviderTest.php` — S

2. **Shipped 2026-06-14: strengthen health readiness.** Health now verifies the registered adapter's package name, build path, and entrypoint, not only that a `react` key exists. — `src/Health/InertiaReactAdapterHealthCheck.php`, `tests/Feature/InertiaReactAdapterServiceProviderTest.php` — S

3. **Done/Shipped: component-map drift tests.** The provider-declared React components are now checked against `resources/js/app.jsx`: each component name must have a matching file under `resources/js/Pages` and a `pages` map entry in the generic app. This catches provider/component-map drift before the generic build breaks. — `src/Providers/InertiaReactAdapterServiceProvider.php`, `resources/js/app.jsx`, `tests/Feature/InertiaReactAdapterServiceProviderTest.php` — S

4. **Done/Shipped: bridge-visible adapter diagnostics.** The shared Inertia bridge health check now reports the configured adapter key, registering package, build path, entrypoint, component count, and npm dependency count. React adapter readiness is therefore visible through the bridge as well as the package-local health check. — `packages/inertia/src/Health/InertiaHealthCheck.php`, `tests/Feature/InertiaBridgeTest.php` — M

## 3. Missing Features

- **No SSR entrypoint.** The package only ships a browser entrypoint. SSR support should be explicit before claiming server-rendered Inertia pages.
- **No visual screenshot contract.** This generic adapter has no user-facing UI by itself. Screenshots should come from React theme/component packages that render actual pages through it.
- **No generated component map.** Components are registered manually in `app.jsx`; a generated map could remove drift once more page/component surfaces exist.

## 4. Risks

2. **React version is a public build contract.** NPM dependency versions are registered as vendor assets. Keep adapter package tests aligned with any React/Vite major bump.

## 5. Positioning

Audience: frontend/package developers. Position this package as the included React client adapter for Capell Inertia, not as a theme. It gives developers a working React entrypoint and dependency contract; themes and component packs own the actual visual experience.
