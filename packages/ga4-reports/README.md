## Docs

- [docs index](docs/README.md)
- [overview.md](docs/overview.md)
- [credits-and-acknowledgements.md](docs/credits-and-acknowledgements.md)
- [data-client.md](docs/data-client.md)

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/ga4-reports/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
