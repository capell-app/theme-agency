## What It Adds

PublishingStudio is Capell's flagship editorial timeline workflow. It gives content teams a premium, Statamic-style publishing experience for Capell: preview, compare, approve, schedule, publish, and rollback every meaningful content change without editing live records directly.

- Draft publishing-studio with copy-on-write editing for Draftable content.
- Signed live preview links, expiry/revocation management, access tracking, and a frontend workspace preview banner.
- Compare and readiness views with diff, dry-run validation, field comments, review assignments, URL-collision checks, stale workspace warnings, and publish checks.
- Release Workspaces for grouping coordinated content, navigation, SEO, media, layout, and package-owned draftable changes into one previewable, approvable, schedulable, atomic publish.
- Approval history for submit, approve, reject, and request-changes decisions, including reviewer notes and required approval levels.
- Scheduled publishing with release-window guards, unpublish dates, embargo windows, review reminders, immediate publishing, version history, rollback, and entity-level restore.
- Activity timeline widgets, stale draft management, import recovery screens, load-test fixtures, and prune commands for audit-friendly editorial operations.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Adds copy-on-write, draftable model support, workspace events, review policies, preview signing, and page resource extenders without moving domain logic into Filament pages.

**For teams:** Gives editors the confidence of a content history product: they can see what changed, preview it safely, gather approval, schedule the release, publish when ready, and restore a previous version if production needs to move back.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

## Data And Persistence

- publishing-studio stores uuid, slug, status, base version, cloned-from workspace, submitted/approved/publish timestamps, and timeline status metadata.
- versions stores uuid, number, live flag, manifest, source workspace, and rollback links.
- preview_links, workspace_approvals, workspace_review_assignments, and workspace_field_comments support preview, compare, approval, comments, assignments, and activity history.
- Core tables receive workspace_id columns.

- Models: `PreviewLink`, `Version`, `Workspace`, `WorkspaceApproval`, `WorkspaceFieldComment`, `WorkspaceReviewAssignment`.
- Migrations: `2026_05_10_190866_01_create_preview_links_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_02_create_publishing-studio_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_03_create_versions_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_04_create_workspace_approvals_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_05_create_workspace_field_comments_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_06_create_workspace_review_assignments_table.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_07_seed_bootstrap_workspace_version.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_08_z_add_workspace_columns_to_core_tables.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_09_z_add_workspace_id_to_external_tables.php`, `2026_05_10_190866_10_z_add_workspace_id_to_import_sessions_table.php`.
- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.

## Extension Points

- Contracts: `ReleaseWorkspaceItemContributor`, `WorkspaceTableActionContributor`.
- Events: `VersionRolledBack`, `WorkspaceEventDispatcher`, `WorkspaceEventSubscriber`, `WorkspaceStateChanged`.
- Listeners: `SendWorkspaceStateNotification`, `StampWorkspaceOnActivity`.
- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install Impact

- Adds workspace and versioning tables.
- Adds workspace_id columns to core and external tables.
- Adds admin resources/pages/widgets and frontend preview route.
- Adds middleware to resolve workspace context.
- Adds commands for install, load testing, and pruning abandoned publishing-studio.
- Adds Migration Assistant adapters so page imports can stage content into Publishing Studio workspaces.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/publishing-studio` in the host Capell application.
- Run migrations through the host application package install flow.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

- Policy: WorkspacePolicy (packages/publishing-studio/src/Policies/WorkspacePolicy.php)
- Gate: ContentSchedulerOverviewWidget: `admin`, `super_admin`

## Common Pitfalls

- Models participating in draft/publish must implement Draftable and be registered.
- Run migrations in order before using copy-on-write.
- Publish checks, stale workspace analysis, URL collisions, and release windows can block publishing.
- Preview links need expiry, revocation, and access-count review.
- Schedule release windows, unpublish dates, embargo rules, and review reminders must match site operations.
- Recovery Center page import screens are owned by Migration Assistant; Publishing Studio contributes workspace target, context, and collision adapters when both packages are installed.

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/publishing-studio/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
- Use backed enums for persisted values and enum labels for Filament options.
