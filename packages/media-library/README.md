# Media Library

Media Library connects Capell to Awcodes Curator media, focal point and responsive metadata, media health reporting, rights metadata checks, duplicate and orphan cleanup reports, usage reports, and Spatie Media migration support.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/media-library`
- Namespace: `Capell\MediaLibrary\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin, console, database
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`
- Third-party dependencies: `awcodes/filament-curator`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Connects Capell to Curator media management, media health reporting, and Spatie Media migration support.
- Gives editors a shared media surface for content, themes, and packages instead of isolated upload fields.
- Gives developers a stable media integration point for rendering, health checks, and migrations.

## Best Used With

- [Foundation Theme](../foundation-theme/README.md)
- [Media AI](../media-ai/README.md)
- [Migration Assistant](../migration-assistant/README.md)

## What It Adds

Media Library connects Capell to Awcodes Curator media, focal point and responsive metadata, media health reporting, rights metadata checks, duplicate and orphan cleanup reports, usage reports, and Spatie Media migration support.

- Curator media model wrapper.
- Media health admin page and table.
- Curator media field factory.
- Focal point, crop preset, responsive variant, rights metadata, duplicate, usage, and orphan media helpers.
- Migration command and action for moving Spatie media into Curator.
- InteractsWithCuratorMedia concern.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Centralises Curator integration behind actions, field factories, and model concerns so packages can use media fields consistently.

**For teams:** Helps site operators audit media records and move legacy media into the current Capell media foundation.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

| Area      | Path                                  | Purpose                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actions   | `packages/media-library/src/Actions`  | Domain operations. Test these directly where possible.              |
| Data      | `packages/media-library/src/Data`     | Structured payloads, form state, view models, and integration data. |
| Models    | `packages/media-library/src/Models`   | Eloquent records owned by the package.                              |

## Admin Surface

- Pages: `MediaHealthPage`, `MediaHealthTable`.

## Commands

- `capell:media-migrate-to-curator {--dry-run : Report what would happen without writing} {--collection=* : Spatie collection names to migrate (repeatable; default: all)} {--owner-type= : Restrict migration to this owner model FQCN} {--chunk=200 : Number of Spatie media rows to process per chunk}` (packages/media-library/src/Console/MigrateSpatieToCuratorCommand.php)

## Data And Persistence

- This package does not define its own migrations.
- It relies on Curator and existing media tables.
- Migration result data records counts and outcomes for Spatie-to-Curator moves.

- Models: `CuratorMedia`.
- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.

## Install Impact

- Adds Curator media field integration.
- Adds media health admin page.
- Adds migration command.
- No package-owned database changes.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/media-library` in the host Capell application.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Admin And Access

- MediaHealthPage (packages/media-library/src/Filament/Pages/MediaHealthPage.php, slug `media-health`)

- Gate: MediaHealthPage: Filament Shield page permissions

## Common Pitfalls

- Install and migrate Curator before relying on CuratorMedia.
- Back up legacy Spatie media before migration.
- Check disk paths and conversions before bulk migration.

## Docs

- [docs index](docs/README.md)
- [credits-and-acknowledgements.md](docs/credits-and-acknowledgements.md)
- [overview.md](docs/overview.md)

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/media-library/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
