# Media Library

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

## What This Plugin Adds

Media Library is an **Available**, **No schema impact** Capell package in the **Capell Foundation** product group. It ships as `capell-app/media-library` and extends these surfaces: admin.

Make Curator the media backbone of your Capell site. One consistent media field everywhere, a media-health dashboard that surfaces missing alt text and unused assets, and a safe, idempotent migration from Spatie Media Library.

After install, admins get package-owned management or reporting surfaces inside Capell.

Status details:

- Status: Available
- Tier: free
- Bundle: foundation
- Composer package: `capell-app/media-library`
- Namespace: `Capell\MediaLibrary`
- Theme key: not applicable

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** The package gives developers package-owned service providers, Actions, Data objects, models, and Filament classes instead of pushing this behaviour into core or application code.

**For teams:** Make Curator the media backbone of your Capell site. One consistent media field everywhere, a media-health dashboard that surfaces missing alt text and unused assets, and a safe, idempotent migration from Spatie Media Library.

## Screens And Workflow

Screenshot contract: `docs/screenshots.json`.

- Media health page (admin, required).
- Media health table (admin, required).
- Curator media field inside a form (admin, required).
- Migration command output or report (console, required).

## Technical Shape

- Service providers: `Capell\MediaLibrary\MediaLibraryServiceProvider`.
- Config files: `packages/media-library/config/media-library.php`.
- Models: `CuratorMedia`.
- Filament classes: `CuratorMediaFieldFactory`, `MediaHealthPage`, `MediaHealthTable`.
- Events: `MediaMissingAltDetected`.
- Actions: `BuildDuplicateMediaQueryAction`, `BuildMediaHealthQueryAction`, `BuildMediaUsageDrilldownAction`, `BuildMissingAltMediaQueryAction`, `BuildMissingRightsMetadataQueryAction`, `BuildOrphanMediaQueryAction`, `DeleteOrphanMediaRecordsAction`, `DiscoverOwnerForeignKeysAction`, `ResolveOwnerForeignKeysAction`, `DispatchMissingAltMediaSignalsAction`, `MigrateSpatieMediaToCuratorAction`, `SanitizeSvgUploadAction`.
- Data objects: `MediaOwnerForeignKeyData`, `MediaUsageReferenceData`, `MigrateSpatieMediaInput`, `MigrateSpatieMediaResult`.
- Console command classes: `MigrateSpatieToCuratorCommand`.
- Manifest contributions: `admin-page: Capell\MediaLibrary\Manifest\MediaHealthPageContribution`, `model: Capell\MediaLibrary\Manifest\CuratorMediaModelContribution`.
- Health checks: `Capell\MediaLibrary\Health\MediaLibraryHealthCheck`.

## Media Handling Contract

Media Library wraps Awcodes Curator as the Capell media backend and does not generate responsive conversions. Curator-backed media exposes configured URLs and metadata; responsive variant generation must come from another package or host implementation.

Evidence and wording rules:

- The capture contract is [docs/screenshots.json](docs/screenshots.json).
- The committed screenshot captures remain runner evidence until they show populated Capell media workflows.
- Do not describe this package as generating responsive variants.
- Keep migration and media-health claims tied to the Curator model, health page, table, field factory, and migration command.

## Data Model

This package has no schema impact. It does not declare package-owned migrations or required tables.

Docs gap: document extension points here if the package delegates persistence to a host package.

## Install Impact

- Admin navigation: adds package-owned Filament classes when registered.
- Permissions: none declared in `capell.json`.
- Public routes: none detected in package route files.
- Database changes: no package migrations declared.
- Settings: no package settings declared.
- Queues or schedules: none detected in standard package paths.
- Cache tags: none declared.
- Commands: console command classes detected: `MigrateSpatieToCuratorCommand`.

## Common Pitfalls

- Verify the package is installed before expecting its provider, views, or extension contributions to run.
- Keep `composer.json`, `composer.local.json`, `capell.json`, docs, screenshots, and tests aligned when the package surface changes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Package surface is missing after install | Provider or manifest is not loaded | Confirm `capell.json`, package `composer.json`, and provider registration | Reinstall the package, refresh Composer autoload, and clear host caches |

## Quick Start

1. Install the package: `composer require capell-app/media-library`.
2. Run the required setup: no package migrations are declared; clear cached config and routes if the host app uses caches.
3. Open the related Capell admin surface and verify Media Library appears.
