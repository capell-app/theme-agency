# Search

Search adds a frontend search route, configurable search drivers, result click tracking, query logging, and admin search insights.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/search`
- Namespace: `Capell\Search\`
- Surfaces: Filament admin, console, HTTP, database
- Service providers: `packages/search/src/Providers/AdminServiceProvider.php`, `packages/search/src/Providers/SearchServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/core`, `capell-app/frontend`
- Third-party dependencies: `lorisleiva/laravel-actions`, `spatie/laravel-data`, `spatie/laravel-package-tools`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Adds frontend search, configurable search drivers, click tracking, query logging, and admin search insights.
- Helps owners understand what visitors cannot find while giving users a public search experience.
- Gives developers driver boundaries and logging Actions instead of coupling search behavior to theme templates.

## Best Used With

- [SEO Suite](../seo-suite/README.md)
- [Site Discovery](../site-discovery/README.md)
- [Insights](../insights/README.md)

## What It Adds

Search adds a frontend search route, configurable search drivers, result click tracking, query logging, and admin search insights.

- Frontend search controller route.
- Database and Scout search drivers.
- Header search render hook.
- Search insights widgets.
- Settings schema and dashboard contributor.
- Actions for search, normalization, logging, click tracking, and purging logs.

## Why It Matters

**For developers:** Uses a Search contract and driver classes so search can start with database queries and move to Scout without changing the frontend surface.

**For teams:** Lets visitors search site content and lets operators review what people searched for, including zero-result terms.

## Built With

This package makes its Composer dependencies visible because they are part of the value proposition, not just plumbing. When an upstream package has a public repository, its linked preview card points readers back to the maintainers so their work gets proper credit.

**Capell packages used here**

- [Capell Admin](https://github.com/capell-app/admin)
- [Capell Core](https://github.com/capell-app/core)
- [Capell Frontend](https://github.com/capell-app/frontend)

**Open-source packages used here**

- [Laravel Actions](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions) - single-purpose action classes that keep package workflows out of controllers and Filament resources.

## Admin Surface

- Widgets: `BuildsSearchInsightsWindow`, `SearchOverviewStatsWidget`, `TopSearchesWidget`, `TrendingSearchesWidget`, `ZeroResultSearchesWidget`.
- Settings: `SearchSettings`.

## Runtime Surface

- Controllers: `SearchController`.
- Routes: `packages/search/routes/web.php`.

## Commands

- `search:purge {--days= : Override retention days}` (packages/search/src/Console/Commands/PurgeSearchLogsCommand.php)

## Data And Persistence

- search_logs stores site, language, query, normalized query, result count, clicked URL, and searched_at.
- Logs connect to sites and languages.
- Retention defaults to 180 days in config.

- Models: `SearchLog`.
- Migrations: `2026_05_10_190868_01_create_search_logs_table.php`.
- Config: `packages/search/config/capell-search.php`.
- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.

## Extension Points

- Contracts: `Search`.
- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install Impact

- Adds search_logs table and settings migration.
- Adds frontend search route.
- Adds optional header search render hook.
- Adds dashboard insights widgets.
- Adds config keys for driver, route, result count, excerpts, logging, hashing, and retention.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/search` in the host Capell application.
- Run migrations through the host application package install flow.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Admin And Access

- None proven in this package directory.

- Gate: SearchOverviewStatsWidget: `admin`, `super_admin`
- Gate: TopSearchesWidget: `admin`, `super_admin`
- Gate: TrendingSearchesWidget: `admin`, `super_admin`
- Gate: ZeroResultSearchesWidget: `admin`, `super_admin`

## Common Pitfalls

- Database driver config must point at searchable columns that exist.
- The default core `pages` table is not a flat search index. Use a flattened table/view, a custom `Search` binding, or Scout for real page content.
- Minimum query length defaults to 2 characters.
- Disable logging or hashing according to privacy requirements.
- Run log purge if retention needs enforcement.

- [search.md](docs/search.md)

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/search/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
- Use backed enums for persisted values and enum labels for Filament options.
