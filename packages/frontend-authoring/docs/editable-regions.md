# Editable Regions

Frontend Authoring adds edit controls after the public page has loaded. Public Blade, cached HTML, theme output, and frontend assets must not contain editor markers.

## Built-in Registry

`EditableRegionRegistry` always starts from the current `PageUrl` and its translated page record. It registers these built-in regions:

| Region           | Field              | Selector config                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Page title       | `title`            | `capell-frontend-authoring.selectors.page_title`   |
| Meta description | `meta.description` | `capell-frontend-authoring.selectors.page_title`   |
| Page content     | `content`          | `capell-frontend-authoring.selectors.page_content` |

Extra regions come from services tagged with `capell-frontend-authoring:editable-regions`.

## Register A Package Region

Register a callable from your package service provider. The callable receives `PageUrl` and returns `EditableRegionPayloadData` objects.

```php
use Capell\Core\Models\PageUrl;
use Capell\FrontendAuthoring\Data\EditableRegionPayloadData;

$this->app->tag([
    static function (PageUrl $pageUrl): array {
        $campaign = $pageUrl->pageable?->campaignLandingPage ?? null;

        if ($campaign === null) {
            return [];
        }

        return [
            new EditableRegionPayloadData(
                model: $campaign::class,
                recordKey: (int) $campaign->getKey(),
                field: 'headline',
                label: __('capell-campaign-studio::form.headline'),
                type: 'text',
                selector: '.campaign-hero__headline',
                currentUrl: $pageUrl->full_url,
                pageUrlId: (int) $pageUrl->getKey(),
                siteId: (int) $pageUrl->site_id,
                languageId: (int) $pageUrl->language_id,
                regionKey: 'campaign.hero.headline',
            ),
        ];
    },
], 'capell-frontend-authoring:editable-regions');
```

Only use selectors that already exist for presentation. Do not add hidden editor-only attributes to public markup just to make authoring easier.

The `regionKey` must be stable for the current page and field. Signed editor routes are revalidated against the current `PageUrl` manifest before rendering or saving, so stale links stop working if the package removes a region, changes its selector, or moves it to another page/site/language context.

## Beacon And Signed Editor Route

| Route                            | Method                             | Purpose                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capell-frontend.beacon`         | `POST /beacon`                     | Resolves the current URL and returns authoring bootstrap only for authenticated admins. |
| `capell-frontend.authoring.edit` | `GET /authoring/regions/{payload}` | Opens one signed editor iframe for one editable field.                                  |

`EditableRegionSigner` signs the payload with `app.key` and creates a temporary signed route for 15 minutes. The payload includes model class, record key, field path, field type, selector, current URL, page URL ID, site ID, language ID, and stable region key.

## Cache Invalidation

`UpdateEditableRegionAction` saves the field, then clears cached URLs recorded for the edited model. `ClearAffectedCachedUrlsAction` refreshes the current page when `capell-admin.auto_refresh_cache` is true or when the cleared URL is the page the admin edited.

If a package registers editable regions for a model that is never recorded in `cached_model_urls`, saves may work but stale cached pages can remain.

## Configuration

| Key                                                | Purpose                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capell-frontend-authoring.enabled`                | Enables the package surface.                                |
| `capell-frontend-authoring.selectors.page_title`   | Selector used for title and meta description edit controls. |
| `capell-frontend-authoring.selectors.page_content` | Selector used for page content editing.                     |

## Safety Checks

Anonymous and non-admin responses must not expose:

- authoring JavaScript or CSS
- editable selectors returned by the beacon
- model class names or IDs
- field paths
- permissions
- signed editor URLs
- package names

When a package changes frontend output, add or keep a test that checks anonymous and non-admin HTML for those strings.
