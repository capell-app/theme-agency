# Frontend Authoring

Frontend authoring bridge and in-page editing for Capell frontend.

## At A Glance

- Package: `capell-app/frontend-authoring`
- Namespace: `Capell\FrontendAuthoring\`
- Surfaces: Livewire, HTTP
- Service providers: `packages/frontend-authoring/src/Providers/FrontendAuthoringServiceProvider.php`
- Capell dependencies: `capell-app/admin`, `capell-app/frontend`, `capell-app/html-cache`
- Third-party dependencies: `spatie/laravel-package-tools`

## Why It Helps Your Capell Workflow

- Lets authenticated admins edit page fields from the public site context without exposing authoring controls to anonymous visitors.
- Protects static caching because the public page loads as ordinary HTML and the admin-only beacon adds editing affordances later.
- Helps editors fix content in place while developers keep signed edit URLs, permissions, and field paths out of public Blade.

## Best Used With

- [HTML Cache](../html-cache/README.md)
- [Layout Builder](../layout-builder/README.md)
- [API](../api/README.md)

## What It Adds

- Frontend authoring bridge and in-page editing for Capell frontend.

## Screens And Workflow

Screenshots are generated from [docs/screenshots.json](docs/screenshots.json) during package deployment.

The documentation screenshots include the package working inside `capell-app`: the runner logs in as an admin, opens the public homepage, waits for the beacon to decorate editable regions, and hovers the first region so the edit control is visible.

## Runtime Surface

- Livewire: `EditRegionField`.
- Controllers: `BeaconController`, `EditRegionController`.
- Routes: `packages/frontend-authoring/routes/web.php`.

## Data And Persistence

- Config: `packages/frontend-authoring/config/capell-frontend-authoring.php`.
- Data objects live in `src/Data/`; use them for payloads, form state, and view models.

## Extension Points

- Register Capell extension points, routes, migrations, settings, render hooks, and resources from service providers.

## Install And Setup

- Install with `composer require capell-app/frontend-authoring` in the host Capell application.
- In this repository, verify package changes with `vendor/bin/pest`; do not use `php artisan`.

## Testing

Run package tests from the repository root:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest packages/frontend-authoring/tests --configuration=phpunit.xml
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Never render authoring controls, model identifiers, field paths, selectors, signed editor URLs, or package hints into public HTML. Add editing affordances only after an authenticated admin beacon response.
- Put behaviour changes in `src/Actions/`; UI classes, commands, and controllers should call actions instead of owning domain logic.
- Use package `Data` classes at boundaries instead of passing anonymous arrays between layers.
